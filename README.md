## Conference Planner

Welcome to the Conference Planner program! This program allows you to easily create and manage conferences, including
setting the date, time, location, sessions and attendees. Conference sessions can we created as live as well as online
event.

With Conference Planner, you can:

- Create and manage conference details, such as the name, date, location, session and events.
- Schedule conference online or book room(s)
- Use the "Calendar" view to see an overview of your meeting and conference schedule.

## Getting started

To get started, simply create a new conference or meeting by clicking on the "New Conference/Meeting" button. You will
then be prompted to enter the details for your conferece/meeting, such as the date, time, location, and attendees. You
can also add an agenda for your conferece/meeting, which will be automatically added to the conferece/meeting summary
that is generated.

Once you have created your conferece/meeting, you can view and manage it from the main dashboard. From here, you can
edit the details of the conferece/meeting, add or remove attendees, and view the conferece/meeting summary.

You can also generate a printable version of the conferece/meeting summary, which can be useful for sharing with
attendees or for keeping a record of the conferece/meeting.

### Thank you
Thank you for using the Conference Planner program. I hope it helps make your conferences and meetings more organized
and productive!
